Stack for Towers of Hanoi Puzzle

Please view the TowerHanoi2 for the programming code.

The purpose of this project was to implment a text based version of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The object
of the puzzle is to move all disks (undetermined) from a source tower (Tower 1/A) to a destination tower
(Tower 3/C) using an intermediate/auxiliary tower. Only one disk may be moved at a time, and no larger
disk can cover a smaller disk on the stack. Each move consisters of taking one disk at a time and
placing it on another tower/stack. We also need to show the current state of the towers in any text-
based reprentation that makes sense, without being overly text-focused.
